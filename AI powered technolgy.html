                  	<h2>How Can AI be used to fight the effects of Global warming?</h2>
                 <P> Carbon being emitted to the environment is one the causes causing global warming and that’s due the increase demand for energy.it is predicted that by 2050 we will have more than 2 billion cars and that  means increased energy consumption  which will lead to more carbon being released to the environment that will cause a lot of damage. Most people have argued that  then why don’t we manufacture vehicles and planes that use electricity?.one thing that they don’t realize is that that will still require electrical energy which is just another  form of energy.</P>
                 <P> one way we can ensure that there is less energy being consumed is readjust everything about our lives, I. e implementing the use of AI in our transport system, changing how we build our cities and finding other ways of generating energy without causing strain on the nature.</P>
                 <P> so how can all this save us from all the problem of energy consumption and save our planet from the devastating effects of climate change? First lets  start on how implementing AI will make use less energy? Having self-driven vehicles will save a lot of energy. We human beings sometimes make a lot of mistakes while driving that in the long run make us consume more energy. For example, if you go to many cities today you will find that the common challenge is traffic congestion and this may due to a number of reasons like poor infrastructure but that one varies , the one that is so common is careless driving as a result of poor decision Making. Having self-driven vehicles will help handle this problem and that means reducing traffic congestion which means that we consume less energy. Latest research has shown that most cars consume most of its energy when it is stacked in traffic.AI powered technology will help us reduce this problem .self driven vehicles  are better at making decisions like deciding on the  the shortest root to take, speed limits  etc</P>
                 <p>
                 	Another way in which AI can help in reducing energy consumption is by platooning. platooning is the air resistance that you get while driving. A research that was conducted shown that a truck moving at 55-miles per hour uses half of its energy  pushing the air In front of it and by the time its at 66 miles per hour the amount of energy is doubled. This problem can be solved by having vehicles driving close to each other so that the vehicle that is In front will be the one that uses more energy alone thus making others consume less energy. This the trick used by long distance cyclist to conserve the energy in their bodies while cycling.So the question is can this be achieved without AI? The answer is yes human beings are capable for  doing this, but as we all know human beings are prone   to mistakes   and if someone catches an emergency breaks he/she might be end up causing an accident(s).Having self driven vehicles will help minimize the accidents that arise from driving close to each other .This is possible because  this vehicles will be exchanging information via wireless connection  so in case  one the vehicles breaks it sends the information to the rest and the rest will automatically adjust their speed limits and response effectively.AI  will  help solve the  human error that might arise  due platooning.

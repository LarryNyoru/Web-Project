                <h2>The Tech cold war</h2>
                <P> most people are not an aware of the cold war going on in the tech world.Recently the United States and China have been engaging in cold war that really poses a lot of questions as far as Data Security is concerned. The US and china are two countries that are at the front or rather the leading pioneers in the Tech world. Now if these two countries are not on the same page then how safe will this project(industry 4.0) be? Imagine a world where everything is controlled by machines communicating with each other using a 5g network. What will happen if this network is brought down?</P>

                 <P>most the companies engineering these projects are based in us and china. Huawei a china-based company ,is among the companies leading in implementing the 5G network.It was recently banned from accessing google services. Most people belief that was for political reasons. the united states belief that Huawei will create a backdoor for the Chinese government to get access to private information about its citizens and sensitive information about its operations which can cause a catastrophic damage.</P>
                 <P> Huawei is big company which  doesn’t operate in china alone. Its headquarters is built on a large campus in china. it is that large that employees have to take trains between the company offices.it has over 180,000 employees.,that alone tells you how big and powerful this company is.</P>
                 <P>in 2018 the US passed a law that stated that if your company makes equipments for Huawei or engage in a collaboration with the Huawei company then you will be violating the law. This has left many companies even in other counties in dilemma since they have to choose between the US and china. And Huawei is not  the only the company that the US is in war with. Another emerging rivalry between the US and china is who is in control off the social media? this led the former president of the united states banning tik-tok in US but he later backtracked on his decision after American based companies (oracle and walamart) showed interest in owning tik-tok .Tik-tok commonly know as Douyin in china  is a social media was developed  by ByteDance-a china based company. Another one that received a lot of scrutiny from the US over its privacy and security issues the we-chat that is owned by Tencent Holdings a china-based company.</P>
                 <P>if you look keenly in all this issues you will realize the big elephant in the room is DATA SECURITY.Cyber security analysis predicted  that one will be able or bring a whole country down without firing any single military weapon.That will be the future of warfare. cyber war will be deadliest war in human history. Most of this analyst have predicted that it will cause more damage more than both world wars combined. All this depend on data security.
                 .The question that i want to ask is, if  AI is to make  this place a better place to live in then how are we going to implement it in our lives if the most powerful countries behind this project are not at peace at each other? it is until the US and china read from the same page only then will we enjoy the fruits of AI powered technology.</P>
                  <P> I think nature has given us good example of how much we can achieve by coming together. Take this example,before a maize plant produces food it undergoes some process like pollination, photosynthesis etc. And if you look at how these processes  occur it involves other aspects of nature i.e., the sunlight needed for the process of photosynthesis and on the other hand insects  are needed for  the process of cross pollination to occur. If we can’t trust each other with our lives then how can we trust each other with technology that we can manipulate to control our life’s?<p>

                        <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
                        <p>most of the time when I interact with many people one of the questions, they normally ask is how can  they be safe from cyber attacks? well in as much as I hate to say this, when it comes to cyber security safety is never guaranteed</p>

					<p>As they normally say there is no system which is secure and if it is secure then its   only safe because it is less popular and therefore it hasn't attracted the attention of many hackers .A less popular systems doesn't attract many hackers simply because they have no value or their value isn’t worth what the hacker wanted. Even in real life you only go after things that are worth the time and resources that you will spend</p>
					<h1> So what do we do?</h1>
					In as much as our data or systems can’t be safe from hackers what we can do is minimize the risk in which this data or systems can be exposed to this hacker</p>
					<p>Cyber security is like a disaster that you can’t prevent it from happening but you can minimize the damage it causes in case it occurs. This can be applied by using the prevention measures that are available today i.e., ensuring that your data is encrypted before transmitting it over the internet. Take this example when you are building a house, you will have to ensure that this house is secure. The question is how do you do that? well the first thing you do is to ensure that the compound is fenced and it has a gate or gates. That way you will have minimized the entry points to the compound and it doesn’t rule out the fact that someone clever cannot climb over the fence and get into the compound but at least it is better than when it had no fence. secondly, you ensure that at the door there is a grill at the door if you are in a hostile environment, then after the grill there is the door. The gate, the grills at the door and the door itself act as layers of security to this house. that means if you want to get into the house you will have to go through the gate, the grills and the door before you finally get into the house. This doesn’t rule out the fact that someone can jump over the fence and get into the house through the window but it will require some extra effort</p>
					<p>Another thing that you have to keep in mind is how strong are this layer of security.it is easier to get through a wooden door compared to a metallic door. We all use passwords in our day-to-day activities i.e., log into our devices or the various accounts i.e., emails. Simple predictable passwords are easy to crack compared to strong passwords. Well, someone may argue that passwords are always encrypted so they are safe. The fact that they are encrypted means that they can be decryption example when setting up a Wi-Fi password most people use the number 1 to 8 just because the password should be at least be 8 characters. That is so easy to predict if I’m a hacker. Another mistake that people make is that people make especially when setting up passwords for online accounts i.e., emails accounts is using the first letter of their first name and the first letter of their last name and   then their number. That pattern can be be easily predicted by hackers.</p>


					<P>One thing that you should know about hackers is that they feed on information’s of the time people time hackers are genius people with some supernatural powers. of course, they are genius that’s because they use the information they have wisely. You may think that some information is irrelevant and can do no harm. Hackers are people who gather information and organized them and come up patterns that can cause catastrophic damage. Take this example you may think that someone else knowing your email is not an issue .as a hacker I can use your mail to get into your phone. I can send you link and attach with malware with some false information how you easily get easily get money then with all your curiously you click on link and just like that you will have installed a malware that I can use to get into your phone.</P>

					<P>There is this common notion nowadays the only way to browse safely is to use incognito mode and not clicking on links that are not secure. I know some of you may be wondering what on earth is incognito mode don’t worry I will explain it in a beat. Let first explain about clicking on links. Yes, it is advisable is to click on only secure links and one way to know if a link is secure is to check I the HTTP ends with an s, HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is a protocol used to link web pages together on the internet, the one with an s means that it is a secure web page but that doesn’t make you device secure. nowadays there is what we call the zero click. Zero click is a technique used by hackers to get hackers to get into devices with zero click.in other words, your device can be hacked into without you clicking on anything. How they normally do is that they call you and whether you pick the call or not that’s not a problem.so long as the call went through that means that there, they have already established a connection from your device to their servers and that’s all they need to do their damage.</P>

					 <p>Now let me explain what is incognito mode as I had promised earlier. this is mode that wipes out your browsing data. Normally when you browsing the pages you have visited and the passwords you used to get into pages are stored on the browser and this can be used to track your footprints on the internet. What incognito mode is that is wipes your browsing data and therefore minimizes your exposure on the internet. However, this doesn’t guarantee safety in that the developers of the web rower can still be able to track you .so if you are using chrome then that means that Google developers can still track you.</p>

					 <P>I may not have explained everything about cyber security but at least you have an overview and hope that you’ve learned something about cyber security.</P>
